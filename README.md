## Game Description
Does your chat know how to count? but how fast?

Cofferica is a mini-game based on Numerica for NumericaJam

- Each time a viewer types a number, the counter will increase. 
- If a viewer types the wrong number, the counter will restart, and the viewer gets an optional but well-deserved timeout.
- You have some time to type the correct number. If the counter reach 0 the last player will be timeouted. Be a good friend.
- A randome number between 3 and 10 viewers can't type consecutive numbers.

Good luck!
