## Game Description
Does your chat know how to count? Are you sure?

Numerica+ is a mini-game based on numerica. The goal is simple: try to play and not get timeouted.

I'm evil? Maybe.
Want to play? I'm sure :)

- Each time a viewer types a number, the counter will increase. 
- If a viewer types the wrong number, the counter will restart, and the viewer gets an optional but well-deserved timeout.
- A viewer can't type two consecutive numbers.
- I can change the rules or not. I can change the game also.

Good luck!
